# Button Pad
An attempt at making a programmable macro keyboard from an arduino

# goals
- Multiple layers
- Save single layer to eeprom
- have single none programmable layer (hard coded)
- have a couple of programmable layers that send triggers to a desktop app for processing
- gui for configuration
- cross platform (fedora, win 10, osx mojave)
- ~~export config to file (This probably wont actually be an export ill just set it up so config is saved to a file that 
can be replaced on another machine)~~
- ~~possibly allow for setting platform specific macros in the desktop app~~
